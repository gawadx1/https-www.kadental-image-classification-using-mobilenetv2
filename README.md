# 🦷 Teeth Disease Classification using MobileNetV2

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify dental diseases using transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture. It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation, and deployment with a Gradio interface.

---

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into the following directory structure:

```

Teeth\_Dataset/
├── Training/
│   ├── CaS/
│   ├── CoS/
│   ├── Gum/
│   ├── MC/
│   ├── OC/
│   ├── OLP/
│   └── OT/
├── Validation/
│   └── (same structure as Training)
└── Testing/
└── (same structure as Training)

````

- Each subfolder contains raw image files corresponding to a specific dental condition.

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Base model:** MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Input size:** 224x224 RGB
- **Top layers:** GlobalAveragePooling2D + Dense softmax
- **Loss function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam

---

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Data loading with `image_dataset_from_directory`
- ✅ Preprocessing with MobileNetV2
- ✅ Optional data augmentation
- ✅ Transfer learning with frozen base model
- ✅ Early stopping to prevent overfitting
- ✅ Gradio app for real-time image classification

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install tensorflow gradio matplotlib
````

### 2. Train the Model

```python
python train.py
```

### 3. Launch the Gradio App

```python
python gradio_app.py
```

This will start a local web app where you can upload an image and get disease predictions.

---

## 📈 Visualize Learning Curve

Use the provided `plot_learning_curve(history)` function to visualize training/validation accuracy and loss over epochs.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set with:

```python
model.evaluate(test_ds)
```

Test accuracy is printed for overall performance.

---

## 📦 Save & Load Model

```python
# Save model
model.save("teeth_classifier_model.h5")

# Load model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("teeth_classifier_model.h5")
```

---

## 📸 Gradio App Preview

```python
gr.Interface(
    fn=preprocess_and_predict,
    inputs=gr.Image(type="pil"),
    outputs=gr.Text(),
    title="Teeth Disease Classifier"
).launch()
```
